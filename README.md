Blah (name TBD) is an experiment to see if https://miek.nl/2022/november/15/provisioning-services/
is actually a sane way of doing thing.

The mind says 'yes', reality says '...' ?

## Notes

## depth

-depth 1 is useless;
we want all systems have the same history, and if the repo becomes big *all* clients will see that
pressure at the same time, not in the ordering in which they came up and received their first pull.

## first commit

There can be 'no commit' which is ok.

git df HEAD^ HEAD -- grafana
fatal: bad revision 'HEAD^'

        package grafana

        /etc/grafana -> grafana/etc

}

## Code

Do we need plugins for this things? Maybe other type of remotes, like mercurial or something?
